# Movie-Rating

### Summary and Recommendations

#### 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a movie ratings dataset to uncover trends in ratings, genre distribution, and correlations between various variables. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the relationships between movie attributes such as budget, revenue, and ratings.

#### 2. Data

The dataset consists of 12,187 movies, with attributes including:

  - Budget: Movie production budget
  - Revenue: Total revenue generated by the movie
  - Vote Average: The average user rating of the movie
  - Genres: The genres that each movie belongs to
  - Release Date: The release date of the movie

#### 3. Data Analysis Steps

 1. Loading the Data: The dataset is contained in a ZIP file, which is extracted and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. The code displays the first few rows of the dataset to inspect the data.
 2. Initial Data Exploration: Basic information such as data types, non-null counts, and summary statistics for numerical columns is displayed to get an overview of the dataset.
 3. Data Cleaning: Missing values in columns like homepage, overview, and tagline are filled with "Not Available" to handle missing data gracefully. The runtime column's missing values are filled with the median value, and rows with missing release_date are dropped. release_date is converted to a proper datetime format for further analysis, and columns containing JSON-like data (genres, keywords, spoken_languages) are parsed into more usable formats.
 4. Feature Engineering: The release year is extracted from the release_date column, and a new genre_list column is created that contains a list of genres for each movie. One-hot encoding is performed for the genres and original language, creating new columns for each genre and language where the presence of a genre or language is represented by 1 or 0. Less relevant columns such as homepage, overview, tagline, and spoken_languages are dropped to clean the DataFrame for analysis.
 5. Visualization 

#### 4. Data Cleaning 

- Missing values in columns like homepage, overview, and tagline were filled with "Not Available".
- Runtime missing values were filled with the median, and rows missing release_date were dropped.
- JSON-like columns such as genres were parsed into usable formats.
- One-hot encoding was performed on genres and original language to enable easy filtering and analysis of the data.

#### 5. Data Visualization

- Histograms of movie ratings
- Box plots of ratings by genre
- Scatter plots of budget vs revenue
- Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between numerical variables
- Line plots showing genre popularity over time
- Bar plots displaying top production companies by revenue

#### 6. Key Findings
      
Distribution of Movie Ratings: The majority of movies have an average rating between 6 and 7, indicating a tendency toward moderately positive reviews.

Genre and Ratings: Documentaries tend to receive higher average ratings, while Horror movies display greater variability in ratings.

Budget and Revenue: A strong positive correlation exists between budget and revenue, suggesting that higher-budget films tend to generate higher revenue, though some exceptions exist.

Genre Popularity Over Time: Action and Adventure movies have consistently remained popular, while other genres like Western have declined over time.
