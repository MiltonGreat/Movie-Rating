# Movie-Rating

### Summary and Recommendations

#### 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a movie ratings dataset to uncover trends in ratings, genre distribution, and correlations between various variables. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the relationships between movie attributes such as budget, revenue, and ratings.

#### 2. Data

The dataset consists of 12,187 movies, with attributes including:

  - Budget: Movie production budget
  - Revenue: Total revenue generated by the movie
  - Vote Average: The average user rating of the movie
  - Genres: The genres that each movie belongs to
  - Release Date: The release date of the movie

#### 3. Data Analysis Steps

1. Initial Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualizations

#### 4. Data Cleaning 

- Handling Missing Values
- Cleaning genres Column
- Type Conversion
- Removing Zero Values
- New Columns
- Date Conversion
- Dropping Irrelevant Columns

#### 5. Data Visualization

- Histograms of movie ratings
- Scatter plots of budget vs revenue
- Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between numerical variables

#### 6. Key Findings
      
Positive Correlation Between Budget and Revenue: The correlation matrix shows a strong positive correlation between budget and revenue (0.705). This suggests that movies with higher budgets tend to generate more revenue.

Profit vs. Budget and Revenue: The profit column has a high correlation with both revenue (0.98) and budget (0.55), indicating that higher budget movies tend to earn more profit, although revenue contributes more strongly to profit.

Relationship Between Vote Count and Popularity: A strong positive correlation between vote_count and popularity (0.75) suggests that movies with more votes are perceived as more popular.

Vote Average's Weak Correlation with Budget and Revenue: Interestingly, vote_average (movie ratings) has a weak negative correlation with budget (-0.03) and a slightly positive correlation with revenue (0.19). This indicates that a higher budget does not necessarily mean a higher movie rating.

Distribution of Movie Ratings: The histogram of vote_average shows that most movies tend to have ratings around 6.0 to 7.0, indicating an average or slightly above-average rating for most films.
